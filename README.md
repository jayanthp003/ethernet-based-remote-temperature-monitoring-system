The growing need for real-time temperature monitoring across various domains such as data centers, greenhouses, and industrial plants has led to the rise of Ethernet-enabled embedded systems. Traditional systems relying on wireless protocols or manual inspection face challenges in range, reliability, and scalability. To address this, the proposed project focuses on designing and implementing a reliable temperature monitoring system using Ethernet communication.
The system uses the PIC18F47Q10 microcontroller paired with an ETH Click board to achieve Ethernet connectivity. A temperature sensor connected to the microcontroller allows for accurate temperature measurement, and data is transmitted over a TCP/IP network to a remote system. The Python-based application on the PC end logs and displays real-time data

simple and industry level embedded based project for temperature monitoring using PIC18F microcontroller 
This project proposes a reliable and cost-effective method to remotely monitor and control temperature using Ethernet communication. It leverages a microcontroller (PIC18F47Q10) interfaced with an Ethernet module (ENC28J60 via ETH Click) to transmit real-time sensor data across a TCP/IP network. A Python-based application on a PC side acts as a TCP client to visualize the data.
Traditional temperature monitoring systems often rely on short-range wireless protocols like Wi-Fi or ZigBee, which suffer from limitations in reliability, scalability, and coverage areaâ€”especially in industrial or server room environments. This system, by contrast, makes use of Ethernet, which is known for stable and secure data transmission, low latency, and longer-range communication. The architecture and implementation presented in this work ensure accuracy and robustness, which are critical for applications like data center monitoring, greenhouses, and industrial automation.
